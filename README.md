## Getting Started

Before you can start using the Agelgl API, you need to sign up and obtain an API key. This key is used for authentication and authorization. Once you have your API key, you can start making requests to the API endpoints.

## Authentication

Authentication is a crucial part of the Agelgl API. You must include your API key in the request headers to access protected resources. To authenticate your requests, add an `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` token, followed by your API key.

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
